# About
For this spell checker project, it takes in a word file and a document file. The word file contains all the valid words that a document can have. If the document contains words that are not in the word file, then the word will be  in red. If the word in the word file is capitalized, then the word will be in blue. If the word is in the word file and is lowercase, then the word will appear as normal.
